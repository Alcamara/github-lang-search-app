# Popular Github Repos By Programming Language Searh App

## Description

This web app allows users to search for popular GitHub repositories by programming language. By default, the page loads popular JavaScript repositories.

Repositories are displayed in a three-column grid below the search section. Each entry includes a link to the repository, a brief description, and an action button. Users can click the repository URL to visit it directly or select the "Details" button to view more information on a dedicated details page.

The details page provides additional insights, including the repository's title, a link to the owner's profile, a description, star count, fork count, issue count, and license information.

Users can also customize their search by selecting from three different programming languages and specifying the number of repositories to retrieve.
